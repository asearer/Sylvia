# Sylvia: From Playground to Platform

**Sylvia** started as a personal ML playground for learning, but it's evolving into a **mono-repo of independent ML microservice apps**. Each app is self-contained but can share common libraries, infrastructure, and tooling.

## Repository Structure

## Features & Goals

* ðŸ§© **Modular Apps:** Each app is isolated and can evolve independently.

* ðŸ”„ **Shared Utilities:** Avoid code duplication and promote reusability.

* ðŸš€ **Scalable:** Add new ML apps easily while maintaining clean structure.

* ðŸ“Š **Experiment-Friendly:** Notebooks, data, and models are organized per app for reproducibility.

## Next Steps

* Migrating the original playground app into the new structure.

* Adding new ML apps as independent services.

* Implementing shared services and libraries to streamline development.

---

*Sylvia is moving from a single app to a full ecosystem of ML tools â€” modular, scalable, and experiment-ready.*
