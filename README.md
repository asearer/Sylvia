# Sylvia: From Playground to Platform

**Sylvia** started as a personal ML playground for learning, but it's evolving into a **mono-repo of independent ML microservice apps**. Each app is self-contained but can share common libraries, infrastructure, and tooling.

## Usage Instructions

Sylvia can be launched using **CLI**, **GUI**, or an **API backend** (future integration). Currently, a **stub backend** is available for safe testing.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

```bash
# Launch CLI with the stub backend
python main.py --mode cli --backend stub
```

**CLI Features:**

* `/switch [profile]` â€” switch active personality profile

* `/hybrid [profile:weight,...]` â€” set weighted hybrid personalities

* `+` / `-` â€” provide feedback for last response

* `exit` â€” quit the CLI

* Save conversations interactively after each message

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

```bash
# Launch GUI with the stub backend
python main.py --mode gui --backend stub
```

**GUI Features:**

* Send messages to Sylvia via a chat box

* Switch personality profiles or set hybrid weights

* Debug logs and response times displayed in real-time

* Stubbed visualization panel (Matplotlib) showing placeholder data

### API (Planned)

* Uvicorn-powered API for remote interaction: `python main.py --mode api`

* Provides REST endpoints for sending messages and switching profiles

* Full model integration coming in future updates

## Features & Goals

* ðŸ§© **Modular Apps:** Each app is isolated and can evolve independently.

* ðŸ”„ **Shared Utilities:** Avoid code duplication and promote reusability.

* ðŸš€ **Scalable:** Add new ML apps easily while maintaining clean structure.

* ðŸ“Š **Experiment-Friendly:** Notebooks, data, and models are organized per app for reproducibility.

* ðŸ’¬ **Interactive Interfaces:** CLI and GUI allow real-time interaction with SylviaBot.

* ðŸ§ª **Safe Testing:** Stubbed backend returns canned responses and prevents runtime errors from the full Personality engine or plotting issues.

## Next Steps

* Re-integrate the full Personality engine and advanced model backends.

* Enable Matplotlib-based visualization in GUI with live personality updates.

* Expand CLI/API backends for local and remote models.

* Add more ML apps and microservices while maintaining modularity.

---

*Sylvia is moving from a single experimental playground to a full ecosystem of ML tools â€” modular, scalable, interactive, and experiment-ready.*
